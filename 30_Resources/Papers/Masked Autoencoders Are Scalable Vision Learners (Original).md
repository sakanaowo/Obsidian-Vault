Abstract

Deep learning has witnessed an explosion of architectures of continuously growing capability and capacity
[33, 25, 57]. Aided by the rapid gains in hardware, models today can easily overfit one million images [13] and
begin to demand hundreds of millions of—often publicly
inaccessible—labeled images [16].
This appetite for data has been successfully addressed in
natural language processing (NLP) by self-supervised pretraining. The solutions, based on autoregressive language
modeling in GPT [47, 48, 4] and masked autoencoding in
BERT [14], are conceptually simple: they remove a portion
of the data and learn to predict the removed content. These
methods now enable training of generalizable NLP models
containing over one hundred billion parameters [4].
The idea of masked autoencoders, a form of more general denoising autoencoders [58], is natural and applicable
in computer vision as well. Indeed, closely related research

This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are
scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our
MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the
input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based
on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric
encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs
the original image from the latent representation and mask
tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion
of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and
meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3× or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning
high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla
ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among
methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pretraining and shows promising scaling behavior.

Figure 1. Our MAE architecture. During pre-training, a large
random subset of image patches (e.g., 75%) is masked out. The
encoder is applied to the small subset of visible patches. Mask
tokens are introduced after the encoder, and the full set of encoded patches and mask tokens is processed by a small decoder
that reconstructs the original image in pixels. After pre-training,
the decoder is discarded and the encoder is applied to uncorrupted
images (full sets of patches) for recognition tasks.

in vision [59, 46] preceded BERT. However, despite significant interest in this idea following the success of BERT,
progress of autoencoding methods in vision lags behind
NLP. We ask: what makes masked autoencoding different
between vision and language? We attempt to answer this
question from the following perspectives:
(i) Until recently, architectures were different. In vision,
convolutional networks [34] were dominant over the last
decade [33]. Convolutions typically operate on regular grids
and it is not straightforward to integrate ‘indicators’ such as
mask tokens [14] or positional embeddings [57] into convolutional networks. This architectural gap, however, has
been addressed with the introduction of Vision Transformers (ViT) [16] and should no longer present an obstacle.
(ii) Information density is different between language
and vision. Languages are human-generated signals that
are highly semantic and information-dense. When training
a model to predict only a few missing words per sentence,
this task appears to induce sophisticated language understanding. Images, on the contrary, are natural signals with
heavy spatial redundancy—e.g., a missing patch can be recovered from neighboring patches with little high-level un-

Figure 2. Example results on ImageNet validation images. For each triplet, we show the masked image (left), our MAE reconstruction†
(middle), and the ground-truth (right). The masking ratio is 80%, leaving only 39 out of 196 patches. More examples are in the appendix.
† As no loss is computed on visible patches, the model output on visible patches is qualitatively worse. One can simply overlay the output with the visible

patches to improve visual quality. We intentionally opt not to do this, so we can more comprehensively demonstrate the method’s behavior.

derstanding of parts, objects, and scenes. To overcome this
difference and encourage learning useful features, we show
that a simple strategy works well in computer vision: masking a very high portion of random patches. This strategy
largely reduces redundancy and creates a challenging selfsupervisory task that requires holistic understanding beyond
low-level image statistics. To get a qualitative sense of our
reconstruction task, see Figures 2 – 4.
(iii) The autoencoder’s decoder, which maps the latent
representation back to the input, plays a different role between reconstructing text and images. In vision, the decoder
reconstructs pixels, hence its output is of a lower semantic
level than common recognition tasks. This is in contrast
to language, where the decoder predicts missing words that
contain rich semantic information. While in BERT the decoder can be trivial (an MLP) [14], we found that for images, the decoder design plays a key role in determining the
semantic level of the learned latent representations.
Driven by this analysis, we present a simple, effective,
and scalable form of a masked autoencoder (MAE) for
visual representation learning. Our MAE masks random
patches from the input image and reconstructs the missing
patches in the pixel space. It has an asymmetric encoderdecoder design. Our encoder operates only on the visible
subset of patches (without mask tokens), and our decoder is

lightweight and reconstructs the input from the latent representation along with mask tokens (Figure 1). Shifting
the mask tokens to the small decoder in our asymmetric
encoder-decoder results in a large reduction in computation.
Under this design, a very high masking ratio (e.g., 75%) can
achieve a win-win scenario: it optimizes accuracy while allowing the encoder to process only a small portion (e.g.,
25%) of patches. This can reduce overall pre-training time
by 3× or more and likewise reduce memory consumption,
enabling us to easily scale our MAE to large models.
Our MAE learns very high-capacity models that generalize well. With MAE pre-training, we can train datahungry models like ViT-Large/-Huge [16] on ImageNet-1K
with improved generalization performance. With a vanilla
ViT-Huge model, we achieve 87.8% accuracy when finetuned on ImageNet-1K. This outperforms all previous results that use only ImageNet-1K data. We also evaluate
transfer learning on object detection, instance segmentation,
and semantic segmentation. In these tasks, our pre-training
achieves better results than its supervised pre-training counterparts, and more importantly, we observe significant gains
by scaling up models. These observations are aligned
with those witnessed in self-supervised pre-training in NLP
[14, 47, 48, 4] and we hope that they will enable our field to
explore a similar trajectory.

Self-supervised learning approaches have seen significant
interest in computer vision, often focusing on different pretext tasks for pre-training [15, 61, 42, 70, 45, 17]. Recently, contrastive learning [3, 22] has been popular, e.g.,
[62, 43, 23, 7], which models image similarity and dissimilarity (or only similarity [21, 8]) between two or more
views. Contrastive and related methods strongly depend on
data augmentation [7, 21, 8]. Autoencoding pursues a conceptually different direction, and it exhibits different behaviors as we will present.

from the original images, showing that the method can generalize.

2. Related Work
Masked language modeling and its autoregressive counterparts, e.g., BERT [14] and GPT [47, 48, 4], are highly
successful methods for pre-training in NLP. These methods
hold out a portion of the input sequence and train models
to predict the missing content. These methods have been
shown to scale excellently [4] and a large abundance of evidence indicates that these pre-trained representations generalize well to various downstream tasks.
Autoencoding is a classical method for learning representations. It has an encoder that maps an input to a latent representation and a decoder that reconstructs the input. For example, PCA and k-means are autoencoders [29]. Denoising
autoencoders (DAE) [58] are a class of autoencoders that
corrupt an input signal and learn to reconstruct the original, uncorrupted signal. A series of methods can be thought
of as a generalized DAE under different corruptions, e.g.,
masking pixels [59, 46, 6] or removing color channels [70].
Our MAE is a form of denoising autoencoding, but different
from the classical DAE in numerous ways.
Masked image encoding methods learn representations
from images corrupted by masking. The pioneering work
of [59] presents masking as a noise type in DAE. Context
Encoder [46] inpaints large missing regions using convolutional networks. Motivated by the success in NLP, related
recent methods [6, 16, 2] are based on Transformers [57].
iGPT [6] operates on sequences of pixels and predicts unknown pixels. The ViT paper [16] studies masked patch
prediction for self-supervised learning. Most recently, BEiT
[2] proposes to predict discrete tokens [44, 50].

Our masked autoencoder (MAE) is a simple autoencoding approach that reconstructs the original signal given its
partial observation. Like all autoencoders, our approach
has an encoder that maps the observed signal to a latent
representation, and a decoder that reconstructs the original signal from the latent representation. Unlike classical
autoencoders, we adopt an asymmetric design that allows
the encoder to operate only on the partial, observed signal
(without mask tokens) and a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the full signal from the latent representation and
mask tokens. Figure 1 illustrates the idea, introduced next.
Masking. Following ViT [16], we divide an image into regular non-overlapping patches. Then we sample a subset of
patches and mask (i.e., remove) the remaining ones. Our
sampling strategy is straightforward: we sample random
patches without replacement, following a uniform distribution. We simply refer to this as “random sampling”.
Random sampling with a high masking ratio (i.e., the ratio of removed patches) largely eliminates redundancy, thus
creating a task that cannot be easily solved by extrapolation
from visible neighboring patches (see Figures 2 – 4). The
uniform distribution prevents a potential center bias (i.e.,
more masked patches near the image center). Finally, the
highly sparse input creates an opportunity for designing an
efficient encoder, introduced next.
MAE encoder. Our encoder is a ViT [16] but applied only
on visible, unmasked patches. Just as in a standard ViT, our
encoder embeds patches by a linear projection with added
positional embeddings, and then processes the resulting set
via a series of Transformer blocks. However, our encoder
only operates on a small subset (e.g., 25%) of the full set.
Masked patches are removed; no mask tokens are used.
This allows us to train very large encoders with only a fraction of compute and memory. The full set is handled by a
lightweight decoder, described next.
MAE decoder. The input to the MAE decoder is the full
set of tokens consisting of (i) encoded visible patches, and
(ii) mask tokens. See Figure 1. Each mask token [14] is a
shared, learned vector that indicates the presence of a miss-

ing patch to be predicted. We add positional embeddings to
all tokens in this full set; without this, mask tokens would
have no information about their location in the image. The
decoder has another series of Transformer blocks.
The MAE decoder is only used during pre-training to
perform the image reconstruction task (only the encoder
is used to produce image representations for recognition).
Therefore, the decoder architecture can be flexibly designed
in a manner that is independent of the encoder design. We
experiment with very small decoders, narrower and shallower than the encoder. For example, our default decoder
has <10% computation per token vs. the encoder. With this
asymmetrical design, the full set of tokens are only processed by the lightweight decoder, which significantly reduces pre-training time.
Reconstruction target. Our MAE reconstructs the input
by predicting the pixel values for each masked patch. Each
element in the decoder’s output is a vector of pixel values
representing a patch. The last layer of the decoder is a linear projection whose number of output channels equals the
number of pixel values in a patch. The decoder’s output is
reshaped to form a reconstructed image. Our loss function
computes the mean squared error (MSE) between the reconstructed and original images in the pixel space. We compute
the loss only on masked patches, similar to BERT [14].1
We also study a variant whose reconstruction target is
the normalized pixel values of each masked patch. Specifically, we compute the mean and standard deviation of all
pixels in a patch and use them to normalize this patch. Using normalized pixels as the reconstruction target improves
representation quality in our experiments.
Simple implementation. Our MAE pre-training can be implemented efficiently, and importantly, does not require any
specialized sparse operations. First we generate a token for
every input patch (by linear projection with an added positional embedding). Next we randomly shuffle the list of
tokens and remove the last portion of the list, based on the
masking ratio. This process produces a small subset of tokens for the encoder and is equivalent to sampling patches
without replacement. After encoding, we append a list of
mask tokens to the list of encoded patches, and unshuffle
this full list (inverting the random shuffle operation) to align
all tokens with their targets. The decoder is applied to this
full list (with positional embeddings added). As noted, no
sparse operations are needed. This simple implementation
introduces negligible overhead as the shuffling and unshuffling operations are fast.
1 Computing the loss only on masked patches differs from traditional

denoising autoencoders [58] that compute the loss on all pixels. This
choice is purely result-driven: computing the loss on all pixels leads to
a slight decrease in accuracy (e.g., ∼0.5%).

4. ImageNet Experiments
We do self-supervised pre-training on the ImageNet-1K
(IN1K) [13] training set. Then we do supervised training to
evaluate the representations with (i) end-to-end fine-tuning
or (ii) linear probing. We report top-1 validation accuracy
of a single 224×224 crop. Details are in Appendix A.1.
Baseline: ViT-Large. We use ViT-Large (ViT-L/16) [16]
as the backbone in our ablation study. ViT-L is very big (an
order of magnitude bigger than ResNet-50 [25]) and tends
to overfit. The following is a comparison between ViT-L
trained from scratch vs. fine-tuned from our baseline MAE:

We note that it is nontrivial to train supervised ViT-L from
scratch and a good recipe with strong regularization is
needed (82.5%, see Appendix A.2). Even so, our MAE pretraining contributes a big improvement. Here fine-tuning is
only for 50 epochs (vs. 200 from scratch), implying that the
fine-tuning accuracy heavily depends on pre-training.

4.1. Main Properties
We ablate our MAE using the default settings in Table 1
(see caption). Several intriguing properties are observed.
Masking ratio. Figure 5 shows the influence of the masking ratio. The optimal ratios are surprisingly high. The ratio of 75% is good for both linear probing and fine-tuning.
This behavior is in contrast with BERT [14], whose typical
masking ratio is 15%. Our masking ratios are also much
higher than those in related works [6, 16, 2] in computer
vision (20% to 50%).
The model infers missing patches to produce different,
yet plausible, outputs (Figure 4). It makes sense of the
gestalt of objects and scenes, which cannot be simply completed by extending lines or textures. We hypothesize that
this reasoning-like behavior is linked to the learning of useful representations.
Figure 5 also shows that linear probing and fine-tuning
results follow different trends. For linear probing, the ac-

curacy increases steadily with the masking ratio until the
sweet point: the accuracy gap is up to ∼20% (54.6% vs.
73.5%). For fine-tuning, the results are less sensitive to the
ratios, and a wide range of masking ratios (40–80%) work
well. All fine-tuning results in Figure 5 are better than training from scratch (82.5%).
Decoder design. Our MAE decoder can be flexibly designed, as studied in Table 1a and 1b.
Table 1a varies the decoder depth (number of Transformer blocks). A sufficiently deep decoder is important
for linear probing. This can be explained by the gap between a pixel reconstruction task and a recognition task: the
last several layers in an autoencoder are more specialized
for reconstruction, but are less relevant for recognition. A
reasonably deep decoder can account for the reconstruction
specialization, leaving the latent representations at a more
abstract level. This design can yield up to 8% improvement
in linear probing (Table 1a, ‘lin’). However, if fine-tuning
is used, the last layers of the encoder can be tuned to adapt
to the recognition task. The decoder depth is less influential
for improving fine-tuning (Table 1a, ‘ft’).
Interestingly, our MAE with a single-block decoder can
perform strongly with fine-tuning (84.8%). Note that a single Transformer block is the minimal requirement to propagate information from visible tokens to mask tokens. Such
a small decoder can further speed up training.
In Table 1b we study the decoder width (number of channels). We use 512-d by default, which performs well under fine-tuning and linear probing. A narrower decoder also
works well with fine-tuning.
Overall, our default MAE decoder is lightweight. It has
8 blocks and a width of 512-d ( gray in Table 1). It only
has 9% FLOPs per token vs. ViT-L (24 blocks, 1024-d).
As such, while the decoder processes all tokens, it is still a
small fraction of the overall compute.

is relative to the entry whose encoder has mask tokens (gray). The
decoder width is 512, and the mask ratio is 75%. † : This entry is
estimated by training ten epochs.

Mask token. An important design of our MAE is to skip
the mask token [M] in the encoder and apply it later in the
lightweight decoder. Table 1c studies this design.
If the encoder uses mask tokens, it performs worse: its
accuracy drops by 14% in linear probing. In this case,
there is a gap between pre-training and deploying: this encoder has a large portion of mask tokens in its input in pretraining, which does not exist in uncorrupted images. This
gap may degrade accuracy in deployment. By removing the
mask token from the encoder, we constrain the encoder to
always see real patches and thus improve accuracy.
Moreover, by skipping the mask token in the encoder,
we greatly reduce training computation. In Table 1c, we
reduce the overall training FLOPs by 3.3×. This leads to
a 2.8× wall-clock speedup in our implementation (see Table 2). The wall-clock speedup is even bigger (3.5–4.1×),
for a smaller decoder (1-block), a larger encoder (ViT-H),
or both. Note that the speedup can be >4× for a masking
ratio of 75%, partially because the self-attention complexity
is quadratic. In addition, memory is greatly reduced, which
can enable training even larger models or speeding up more
by large-batch training. The time and memory efficiency
makes our MAE favorable for training very large models.

Right: grid-wise sampling that keeps one of every four patches.
Images are from the validation set.

Reconstruction target. We compare different reconstruction targets in Table 1d. Our results thus far are based on
pixels without (per-patch) normalization. Using pixels with
normalization improves accuracy. This per-patch normalization enhances the contrast locally. In another variant, we
perform PCA in the patch space and use the largest PCA
coefficients (96 here) as the target. Doing so degrades accuracy. Both experiments suggest that the high-frequency
components are useful in our method.
We also compare an MAE variant that predicts tokens,
the target used in BEiT [2]. Specifically for this variant,
we use the DALLE pre-trained dVAE [50] as the tokenizer,
following [2]. Here the MAE decoder predicts the token indices using cross-entropy loss. This tokenization improves
fine-tuning accuracy by 0.4% vs. unnormalized pixels, but
has no advantage vs. normalized pixels. It also reduces linear probing accuracy. In §5 we further show that tokenization is not necessary in transfer learning.
Our pixel-based MAE is much simpler than tokenization. The dVAE tokenizer requires one more pre-training
stage, which may depend on extra data (250M images [50]).
The dVAE encoder is a large convolutional network (40%
FLOPs of ViT-L) and adds nontrivial overhead. Using pixels does not suffer from these problems.
Data augmentation. Table 1e studies the influence of data
augmentation on our MAE pre-training.
Our MAE works well using cropping-only augmentation, either fixed-size or random-size (both having random
horizontal flipping). Adding color jittering degrades the results and so we do not use it in other experiments.
Surprisingly, our MAE behaves decently even if using
no data augmentation (only center-crop, no flipping). This
property is dramatically different from contrastive learning
and related methods [62, 23, 7, 21], which heavily rely
on data augmentation. It was observed [21] that using
cropping-only augmentation reduces the accuracy by 13%

noticeable improvement. Here each point is a full training schedule. The model is ViT-L with the default setting in Table 1.

and 28% respectively for BYOL [21] and SimCLR [7]. In
addition, there is no evidence that contrastive learning can
work without augmentation: the two views of an image are
the same and can easily satisfy a trivial solution.
In MAE, the role of data augmentation is mainly performed by random masking (ablated next). The masks are
different for each iteration and so they generate new training
samples regardless of data augmentation. The pretext task
is made difficult by masking and requires less augmentation
to regularize training.
Mask sampling strategy. In Table 1f we compare different
mask sampling strategies, illustrated in Figure 6.
The block-wise masking strategy, proposed in [2], tends
to remove large blocks (Figure 6 middle). Our MAE with
block-wise masking works reasonably well at a ratio of
50%, but degrades at a ratio of 75%. This task is harder
than that of random sampling, as a higher training loss is
observed. The reconstruction is also blurrier.
We also study grid-wise sampling, which regularly keeps
one of every four patches (Figure 6 right). This is an easier task and has lower training loss. The reconstruction is
sharper. However, the representation quality is lower.
Simple random sampling works the best for our MAE. It
allows for a higher masking ratio, which provides a greater
speedup benefit while also enjoying good accuracy.
Training schedule. Our ablations thus far are based on
800-epoch pre-training. Figure 7 shows the influence of the
training schedule length. The accuracy improves steadily
with longer training. Indeed, we have not observed saturation of linear probing accuracy even at 1600 epochs.
This behavior is unlike contrastive learning methods, e.g.,
MoCo v3 [9] saturates at 300 epochs for ViT-L. Note that
the MAE encoder only sees 25% of patches per epoch,
while in contrastive learning the encoder sees 200% (twocrop) or even more (multi-crop) patches per epoch.

Figure 8. MAE pre-training vs. supervised pre-training, evaluated by fine-tuning in ImageNet-1K (224 size). We compare with
the original ViT results [16] trained in IN1K or JFT300M.

4.2. Comparisons with Previous Results
Comparisons with self-supervised methods. In Table 3
we compare the fine-tuning results of self-supervised ViT
models. For ViT-B, all methods perform closely. For ViT-L,
the gaps among methods are bigger, suggesting that a challenge for bigger models is to reduce overfitting.
Our MAE can scale up easily and has shown steady improvement from bigger models. We obtain 86.9% accuracy
using ViT-H (224 size). By fine-tuning with a 448 size, we
achieve 87.8% accuracy, using only IN1K data. The previous best accuracy, among all methods using only IN1K
data, is 87.1% (512 size) [67], based on advanced networks.
We improve over the state-of-the-art by a nontrivial margin
in the highly competitive benchmark of IN1K (no external
data). Our result is based on vanilla ViT, and we expect
advanced networks will perform better.
Comparing with BEiT [2], our MAE is more accurate
while being simpler and faster. Our method reconstructs
pixels, in contrast to BEiT that predicts tokens: BEiT reported a 1.8% degradation [2] when reconstructing pixels
with ViT-B.2 We do not need dVAE pre-training. Moreover, our MAE is considerably faster (3.5× per epoch) than
BEiT, for the reason as studied in Table 1c.
2 We observed the degradation also in BEiT with ViT-L: it produces
85.2% (tokens) and 83.5% (pixels), reproduced from the official code.

The MAE models in Table 3 are pre-trained for 1600
epochs for better accuracy (Figure 7). Even so, our total
pre-training time is less than the other methods when trained
on the same hardware. For example, training ViT-L on 128
TPU-v3 cores, our MAE’s training time is 31 hours for 1600
epochs and MoCo v3’s is 36 hours for 300 epochs [9].
Comparisons with supervised pre-training. In the original ViT paper [16], ViT-L degrades when trained in IN1K.
Our implementation of supervised training (see A.2) works
better, but accuracy saturates. See Figure 8.
Our MAE pre-training, using only IN1K, can generalize better: the gain over training from scratch is bigger for
higher-capacity models. It follows a trend similar to the
JFT-300M supervised pre-training in [16]. This comparison shows that our MAE can help scale up model sizes.

4.3. Partial Fine-tuning
Table 1 shows that linear probing and fine-tuning results
are largely uncorrelated. Linear probing has been a popular
protocol in the past few years; however, it misses the opportunity of pursuing strong but non-linear features—which is
indeed a strength of deep learning. As a middle ground, we
study a partial fine-tuning protocol: fine-tune the last several layers while freezing the others. This protocol was also
used in early works, e.g., [65, 70, 42].
Figure 9 shows the results. Notably, fine-tuning only one
Transformer block boosts the accuracy significantly from
73.5% to 81.0%. Moreover, if we fine-tune only “half” of
the last block (i.e., its MLP sub-block), we can get 79.1%,
much better than linear probing. This variant is essentially
fine-tuning an MLP head. Fine-tuning a few blocks (e.g., 4
or 6) can achieve accuracy close to full fine-tuning.
In Figure 9 we also compare with MoCo v3 [9], a contrastive method with ViT-L results available. MoCo v3 has
higher linear probing accuracy; however, all of its partial
fine-tuning results are worse than MAE. The gap is 2.6%
when tuning 4 blocks. While the MAE representations are
less linearly separable, they are stronger non-linear features
and perform well when a non-linear head is tuned.

AP follows a similar trend as box AP.

These observations suggest that linear separability is not
the sole metric for evaluating representation quality. It has
also been observed (e.g., [8]) that linear probing is not well
correlated with transfer learning performance, e.g., for object detection. To our knowledge, linear evaluation is not
often used in NLP for benchmarking pre-training.

5. Transfer Learning Experiments

Semantic segmentation. We experiment on ADE20K [72]
using UperNet [63] (see A.4). Table 5 shows that our pretraining significantly improves results over supervised pretraining, e.g., by 3.7 points for ViT-L. Our pixel-based MAE
also outperforms the token-based BEiT. These observations
are consistent with those in COCO.
Classification tasks. Table 6 studies transfer learning on
the iNaturalists [56] and Places [71] tasks (see A.5). On
iNat, our method shows strong scaling behavior: accuracy
improves considerably with bigger models. Our results surpass the previous best results by large margins. On Places,
our MAE outperforms the previous best results [19, 40],
which were obtained via pre-training on billions of images.
Pixels vs. tokens. Table 7 compares pixels vs. tokens as the
MAE reconstruction target. While using dVAE tokens is
better than using unnormalized pixels, it is statistically similar to using normalized pixels across all cases we tested. It
again shows that tokenization is not necessary for our MAE.

Object detection and segmentation. We fine-tune Mask
R-CNN [24] end-to-end on COCO [37]. The ViT backbone
is adapted for use with FPN [36] (see A.3). We apply this
approach for all entries in Table 4. We report box AP for
object detection and mask AP for instance segmentation.
Compared to supervised pre-training, our MAE performs
better under all configurations (Table 4). With the smaller
ViT-B, our MAE is 2.4 points higher than supervised pretraining (50.3 vs. 47.9, APbox ). More significantly, with the
larger ViT-L, our MAE pre-training outperforms supervised
pre-training by 4.0 points (53.3 vs. 49.3).
The pixel-based MAE is better than or on par with the
token-based BEiT, while MAE is much simpler and faster.
Both MAE and BEiT are better than MoCo v3 and MoCo
v3 is on par with supervised pre-training.

6. Discussion and Conclusion
Simple algorithms that scale well are the core of deep
learning. In NLP, simple self-supervised learning methods
(e.g., [47, 14, 48, 4]) enable benefits from exponentially
scaling models. In computer vision, practical pre-training
paradigms are dominantly supervised (e.g. [33, 51, 25, 16])
despite progress in self-supervised learning. In this study,
we observe on ImageNet and in transfer learning that
an autoencoder—a simple self-supervised method similar
to techniques in NLP—provides scalable benefits. Selfsupervised learning in vision may now be embarking on a
similar trajectory as in NLP.
On the other hand, we note that images and languages
are signals of a different nature and this difference must
be addressed carefully. Images are merely recorded light
without a semantic decomposition into the visual analogue
of words. Instead of attempting to remove objects, we remove random patches that most likely do not form a semantic segment. Likewise, our MAE reconstructs pixels, which
are not semantic entities. Nevertheless, we observe (e.g.,
Figure 4) that our MAE infers complex, holistic reconstructions, suggesting it has learned numerous visual concepts,
i.e., semantics. We hypothesize that this behavior occurs
by way of a rich hidden representation inside the MAE. We
hope this perspective will inspire future work.
